# Showcase
These are some of the programming codes to projects I worked on during my training to become a software developer, in the languages I've learned so far (mostly python and java for now). Projects with same names are as close to identical as possible, just written in different languages as practice and learning process to see the differences in the respective languages (e.g. python vs. java).
